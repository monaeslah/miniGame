# Bomberman Game (Pomberman Clone)

This project is a Bomberman-like game (Pomberman clone) built entirely with pure JavaScript using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It's a fun, browser-based game that allows you to move your character, plant bombs, defeat enemies, and advance through levels, all rendered with HTML and CSS (without using <canvas>).
